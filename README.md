# Computational Linguistics - Spring 26
I will upload new files to this repository as the class progresses.


## Setup Guide

Follow this guide to set up your working environment on **UCloud** and start working on the project tasks.

---

### Overview

You will:

1. Start a UCloud run  
2. Navigate your files using the terminal  
3. Clone this github repository
4. Create a Python virtual environment with `uv`
5. Start working on the Python tasks  

---

### 1. Start a UCloud Run

1. Go to CompLing-F26 workspace
2. Start a *Coder Python* run
3. Fill out necessary inputs.
4. Open Interface

### 2. Navigate to your memberfiles
You want to avoid being outside ´/work/*your_name_XXXX*´ as this leads to your files not being saved.

1. Open the terminal
2. Use the command `ls` to see you current file location
3. Use `cd` to change your current directory, you can use the tab-key to avoid typos
4. Navigate to your memberfiles.

### 3. Clone this github repository
Once you are located in your memberfiles, you are able to download the exercise for today.

1. Find the url for this repository at the `<> Code`-button
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/lauritswl/CompLing_Class1.git` in the terminal

### 4. Create a Python virtual environment with `uv`
`uv` is a package management software, that is easy to use as a beginner, and has a lot of cool tools as you improve.
For now you just need to use it for seting up a venv, installing packages and running files.

1. Navigate your cd into the newly downloaded repository `cd CompLing_Class1/`
2. Create a venv `uv venv`
3. Try to run the python script and get an error: `uv run Class1.py`
4. Install pandas in your environment `uv pip install pandas`
5. Run the script again `uv run Class1.py`

### 5. Start working on the Python tasks  
I have created a set of tasks that investigate the relationship between sentence length and proficiency in a second language.
Try to complete these tasks without generative-AI, as they will be way to easy otherwise, and should be manageable with only google.
Or ask me for help, thats what im here for! :))
